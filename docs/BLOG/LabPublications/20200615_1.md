**Title: Ribosomal RNA Biogenesis and Its Response to Chilling Stress in Oryza sativas**

​		Rice rDNAs mainly occur as a cluster on Chromosome 9 in ***Nipponbare***, the well-annotated *Japonica* rice genome. Compared with the 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rDNAs, the DNA sequences for ETS and ITS spacers are much more variable in both length and sequence between *Nipponbare* and *A. thaliana* accession Col-0.

​		Here, this study examined ribosome biogenesis at the level of pre-rRNA processing in rice, especially the processing sites, rRNA intermediates and processing pathways by circular RT-PCR (cRT-PCR).

​		Northern blot assays showed that the major 'ITS1-first' and the minor '5' ETS-first' processing pathways co-exist *in vivo* to ensure rRNA maturation in rice. And finally, they found that rRNA biogenesis in rice was inhibited by chilling stress mainly at the pre-rRNA processing (P-A3 and 27SA2) level.
